# FP1 - Proposal for Critique

## Idea Sketches

* Idea 1
![You and The Stars](/Users/lizethanaya/Downloads/MyResume/git/pui-homework-template/final-project/images/you-and-the-stars.png)
This astrology platform features an interactive night sky with clickable constellations for each zodiac sign. Users can immerse themselves in their sign’s constellation to explore personalized traits, compatible crystals, and a tool for checking sign compatibility with friends or partners. The design will be accessible with high contrast, alt text, and keyboard navigation, with thorough research ensuring accurate, engaging insights across all twelve signs.

* Idea 2 
![Personal Porfolio](/Users/lizethanaya/Downloads/MyResume/git/pui-homework-template/final-project/images/personal-portfolio.png)
This portfolio site highlights your professional journey, values, and skills for potential employers or collaborators. The homepage offers a clean introduction with a personal tagline, followed by a projects section in a grid layout showcasing your role, outcomes, and visuals. An "About Me" page shares your background and aspirations, while a contact page provides a simple form and social media links. The design will balance aesthetics and functionality for easy navigation, emphasizing key projects in a clear, uncluttered layout.

* Idea 3 
![Happy Reading](/Users/lizethanaya/Downloads/MyResume/git/pui-homework-template/final-project/images/happy-reading.png)
This book blog invites users to explore interactive reviews and recommendations in a visually engaging bookshelf layout with clickable book covers. Selecting a book opens a review section with your insights, key themes, and tailored recommendations, while interactive features allow filtering by genre or rating. The design will focus on a clean, accessible bookshelf display and subtle interactive elements to enhance engagement without distracting from content.

## Feedback Summary

* You and The Stars
	- Allison: Is the homepage meant to show only your constellation, or should it display everyone’s? It could feel more personal if it defaults to your constellation but still allows you to see others.
    	- Suggestion: In a portfolio context, consider balancing image size to avoid excessive scrolling. A zoom-in option could add more detail without overwhelming the viewer.

	- Megan: Enjoys the addition of crystals and compatibility features.
	    - Clarified: This will be a web-based application.

	- Anna: Likes the crystals feature and wonders if compatibility data can be saved.
	    - Suggestion: A way to store compatibility information would be useful.

* Personal Porfolio
    
    - Allison: How large are the images going to be?
    	- Suggestion: In a portfolio context, consider balancing image size to avoid excessive scrolling. A zoom-in option could add more detail without overwhelming the viewer.

	- Megan: Focus on showcasing 3-4 key projects on the homepage, with additional projects listed below under a header labeled “Other Projects.”

	- Anna: Keep the navigation bar at the top and make it "sticky" for easy access.
	    - Suggestion: Include a “Back to Top” button to quickly navigate to the top of the page.

*  Happy Reading
    - Allison: Emphasize accessibility, especially for an interactive bookcase feature. The concept is strong otherwise.

	- Megan: Mentions that GoodReads can be difficult to track, so this alternative is promising.
	    - Suggestion: Think about how the profile and login process might work, especially if this is intended for a community.

	- Anna:  Likes the idea and suggests placing “current read” above “favorites” on the homepage to emphasize a personal, blog-like feel.

## Feedback Digestion

Based on the feedback received, here are the specific critiques I’ll incorporate into my next design iteration and my reasoning behind each decision:

* Image Sizing and Zoom-In Option (Allison)

- Incorporate: I’ll implement a balanced image size with a zoom-in option for recruiters to view details without needing to scroll excessively. This aligns with the goal of creating an easy-to-navigate portfolio while allowing in-depth views of key projects.

* Highlighting Key Projects on the Homepage (Megan)

- Incorporate: Featuring 3-4 key projects prominently on the homepage is a great way to catch recruiters’ attention quickly. I’ll add a “Other Projects” section below to house additional work, streamlining the homepage layout and focusing on the most impactful projects.
Sticky Navigation and “Back to Top” Button (Anna)

* Incorporate: Keeping navigation fixed at the top will make it easier for users to explore the site, and the “Back to Top” button ensures a smoother user experience on longer pages. This feedback aligns well with creating a user-friendly design.
Image Sizing Constraints (Allison)

- Dismiss: I’ll take a balanced approach to image sizing but avoid too small of an image constraint, as visuals are essential in showcasing project details. I want images to feel accessible without overwhelming the user, so I’ll strike a balance with slightly larger images paired with the zoom feature.
These adjustments reflect my goal to create a portfolio that is visually engaging, easily navigable, and highlights key projects without overwhelming viewers. Each incorporated element enhances the portfolio’s usability and appeal for recruiters while respecting design constraints.
