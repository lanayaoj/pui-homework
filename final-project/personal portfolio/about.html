            <h2>What drives me</h2>
            <p> üèúÔ∏èüåûüá≤üáΩüß°</p> 
            <p>I grew up in the vast deserts of New Mexico, where the landscape's spiritual energy constantly fuels my creativity. There's a quiet strength in the desert that I carry with me in both my personal and professional life. 
                My roots trace back to Northern Mexico, and my cultural heritage shapes everything I do, from the way I approach design to how I build connections. 
                I bring a sense of community, resilience, and authenticity into my work and life.</p>
            <p> ‚ú®üßöüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüîÆü¶ã </p>
            <p>When I'm not busy brainstorming the next big idea, you'll likely find me experimenting with new latte recipes, paddleboarding (or attempting not to faceplant into the water), hitting the gym, or collecting crystals that definitely aren't magical‚Ä¶ but I like to think they are. 
                Balance is key‚Äîrecharging and having a little fun while staying inspired!</p>
