                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>"Bias Bingo" is an innovative classroom activity designed to promote responsible use of generative AI in education. The project aims to incentivize college students to critically engage with AI tools, identify biases, and foster open discussions about AI's role in learning. By gamifying the process of bias detection, Bias Bingo transforms potential skepticism about AI into an opportunity for active learning and skill development.</p>

                    <h2>Project Details</h2>
                    <p>Bias Bingo leverages several key technologies and methodologies:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Anonymous reporting system for submitting bias reports</li>
                        <li>AI-assisted review process for efficient validation of reports</li>
                        <li>Interactive digital or physical Bingo card for tracking progress</li>
                        <li>Structured framework for facilitating classroom discussions about identified biases</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The project faced challenges in designing an engaging yet educational game mechanic, ensuring fairness in the bias validation process, and creating a system adaptable to various course subjects and AI tools. These challenges were addressed through iterative design and user feedback from contextual interviews and speed dating sessions with students.</p>
